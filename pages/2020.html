    <h1>🌸 2020 – Hoge Bare Began ❤️</h1>
    <p>
      Covid time – the world had paused, but for us, it was full-time calls, endless chats, and unstoppable laughter.  
      We used to talk *every single day*, from the moment we woke up till we said goodnight.  
      Slowly, our conversations shifted from English to namma Kannada — and that just made everything feel more *us*.  
      Even though we couldn’t meet in person, nothing felt missing.  
      Because the connection was so real. So pure. So perfect.  
      <br><br>
      “Hoge”, “bare”, “aa maathu”, “aa vibe” —  
      all those silly yet meaningful words started here,  
      and they stuck around, becoming a language only we truly understood.  
      <br><br>
      That first lockdown... it could’ve felt lonely or heavy.  
      But with you in it, it felt peaceful. Warm. Like a little bubble of happiness we had built together.  
    </p>
