    <h1>2022 – College & Vulnerables 💜</h1>
    <p>
      Life slowly went back to normal after Covid, and college began again.  
      But this time… we were apart. Different colleges, different routines.  
      Still, we never let that distance grow. We kept texting, calling, and checking in — just like always.  
      And whenever she came nearby for her music class, those tiny meet-ups felt like gold.  
      <br><br>
      That year, something changed. We started opening up more.  
      Not just the happy stories — but even the tough ones, the vulnerable ones.  
      We shared things we never said to anyone else.  
      And through all of it, the bond just got deeper and stronger. 💜
